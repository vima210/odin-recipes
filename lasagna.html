    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.

    <p><em>This is just a lasagna, nothing fancy:</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>These are the required ingredients:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Meat: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
        <li>· Onion: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.
        </li>
        <li>· Canned tomatoes: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.
        </li>
        <li>· Fresh herbs: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.
        </li>
        <li>· Spices and seasonings: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>· Noodles: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.
        </li>
        <li>· Cheese: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
        </li>
        <li>· Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).
        </li>
       </ul>

       <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <p>These are the required steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.

        </li>
        <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.

        </li>
    </ol>
